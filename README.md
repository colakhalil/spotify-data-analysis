# spotify-data-analysis
This project aims to apply exploratory data analysis techniques to a Spotify playlist to better understand the characteristics of the songs in the playlist. This project is based on how to clean and transform data, visualize distributions, and uncover insights that can help us make informed decisions about the playlist's content and structure using libraries such as Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib.
